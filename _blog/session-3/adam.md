Part of the reason I was interested in this class is because of what I think is a significant relationship and overlap between information privacy and open data. I've held a certification in privacy for three years now, since I did some privacy policy and compliance work for the Department of Defense. The thing that immediately struck me about this week's readings was Josh Tauberer's 14 Principles of Open Government Data. For a quick recap, they are:

* Online and Free, Primary, Timely, Accessible (Principles 1-4)
* Analyzable Data in Open Formats (Principles 5 and 7)
* No Discrimination and License-Free (Principles 6 and 8)
* Publishing Data with Permanence, Trust, and Provenance (Principles 9-11)
* On The Openness Process (Public Input, Public Review, and Coordination; Principles 12-14)

What I found interesting, but not really surprising, about these principles is their similarity to what are commonly called Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPs) (Don't ask me why there's only one "P"!) in the privacy community. These vary depending on the source, but the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (a major promulgator of federal privacy policies and regulations) lists them as:

* Transparency
* Individual Participation
* Purpose Specification
* Data Minimization
* Use Limitation
* Data Quality and Integrity
* Security
* Accountability and Auditing

U.S. DHS, Privacy Policy Guidance Memorandum 3-4 (Dec. 29, 2008), available at http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/privacy/privacy_policyguide_2008-01.pdf. 

There are some predictable areas of overlap between the two sets of principles, and also some places where they differ or are likely to conflict without appropriate policy guidance. Sticking with Tauberer's groupings, "Online and Free, Primary, Timely, Accessible" are basically specific facets of what most FIPs would call "Transparency" or "Notice." But the difference here seems to be the underlying goal. Open data is focused on public availability, while transparency for the privacy practitioner means nothing more than that the data collector (here, the government) lets you know what they're up to. So, there's a little tension there already. 

"Analyzable Data in Open Formats" corresponds with a few of the FIPs. First, privacy policies almost always include something about "Individual Participation" or guarantees of access to one's own data. Ordinarily this means that the data must be in some usable format. The same goes for "Accountability and Auditing," which depend on analyzability. 

The open government data principles of "Public Input, Public Review, and Coordination" are also similar to "Individual Participation" and "Use Limitation." The key differences here are 1) the scope of availability and 2) the scope of use. In most cases, private information will be available only to the person from whom it was collected - not the public. Open Data principle 14, Interagency Coordination, calls for "interoperability" to "derive new uses" of data. It wants not only to use data fully but to find new ways to use it. The "Use Limitation" FIP, on the other hand, is usually concerned with preventing someone from doing more than was originally intended with personal information. Based on what I've seen in my professional experience, there's a long way to go here in both directions. Government can and should maximize the use of whatever data it can make public. On the other hand, government is obliged to restrict the uses of certain types of information. But even private data and systems that are use-limited must still be interoperable in certain contexts, i.e., matters of national security. 

I think it would be interesting to see government policies treat open data and privacy principles under a single umbrella, once both have more fully matured
